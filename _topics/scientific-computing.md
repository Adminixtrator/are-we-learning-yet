Several crates have populated the scientific computing space
especially regarding matrix operations and linear algebra.
But it's still too early to know which crates will emerge as
central to a robust scientific computing ecosystem.

Given the value of iterative analysis in scientific computing,
it's worth checking out [rusti REPL](https://github.com/murarth/rusti).
There was some progress on a [Jupyter backend for Rust](https://github.com/pwoolcoc/jupyter-rs)
but it seems to have stalled. You can also find a relevant rusti issue
tracking this [here](https://github.com/murarth/rusti/issues/43).

Also, check out some of these resources:

- [A gemmed rabbit hole](http://bluss.github.io/rust/2016/03/28/a-gemmed-rabbit-hole/) - concerning matrix multiplication
- [Linear Algebra in Rust](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/03/23/linear-algebra-in-rust.html) - intro to the module that became [rulinalg](https://crates.io/crates/rulinalg)
