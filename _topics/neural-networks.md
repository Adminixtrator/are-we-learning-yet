Consistent with recent deep learning trends,
the Rust community has followed suit by building several neural network libraries.

[Leaf](https://crates.io/crates/leaf) made a huge splash in the community
and included great resources like the [Leaf Book](http://autumnai.com/leaf/book/)
and talks like [this one](https://air.mozilla.org/rust-berlin-machine-learning-leaf-and-collenchyma/).
Unfortunately [the team behind Leaf moved on](https://medium.com/@mjhirn/tensorflow-wins-89b78b29aafb#.pvv7a6dm7),
but there is interest and a small amount of activity in possibly [reviving a fork](https://github.com/autumnai/leaf/issues/108).
One such fork is [juice](https://crates.io/crates/juice).

Taking a page from python's scikit-learn project, [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine)
is another major ML crate in the Rust ecosystem. It also powers [Learning Machines](https://learning-machines.herokuapp.com/),
a set of interactive tutorials on machine learning, and [this presentation](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/07/28/rusty-machine-talk.html#/)
provides a solid introduction.

And check out the much newer [alumina](https://crates.io/crates/alumina) crate, the backbone of the easy-to-use
"super resolution" image enhancer [rusty_sr](https://github.com/millardjn/rusty_sr).

Other neural network libraries have been created, but often exist as experimental projects.
Some of the projects listed hear appear to be inactive, but are still listed to serve as an inspiration
for any future projects.
